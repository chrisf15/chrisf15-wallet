== Development instructions

=== Code Design

The project is based on

- Electron + NodeJS
- Typescript
- React + Redux
- Rust for some modules

Once nodenv is installed:

----
$ nodenv install
----

The required version of `node` >= `v12`.

=== Dependencies

==== Libs

You need `libudev`, `libusb-1.0-0`, `libusb-1.0-0-dev` installed on Linux

.On Ubuntu:
----
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
----

====  NPM packages


.Install development tools
----
npm install -g node-gyp lerna yarn
----

.For windows run also:
----
npm install -g npm windows-build-tools@4.0.0
----

.Install dependencies:
----
lerna bootstrap
----

=== Run for development

.Build sources
----
$ lerna run build
----

.Start Electron application
----
$ lerna run start:electron
----

=== Troubleshooting

=== Logs

Electron and Emerald logs persisted in:

 * OSX: `~/Library/Logs/chrisf15-wallet/log.log`
 * Linux: `~/.config/chrisf15-wallet/log.log`

=== Building distributions in development

You can run a distribution build in your development environment. Assuming
you've already compiled `./src/` and `./electron/`, you'll be able to run:

----
yarn build:dist
----

This command will build for _your current system_. Note that there are configurations for
several systems (OSX, Linux, Windows) specified in the `"build"` field of `package.json`, but the `dist` command will by default only build for the system it's on.

Note: If you're developing on OSX and have a developer signing identity on your machine, you can
optionally disable that with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`.

OSX is also able to build for Linux. Add `-ml` to that raw command to build for
both OSX and Linux at the same time.

== Run tests

----
yarn test:watch
----

or for single run:
----
yarn test
----
